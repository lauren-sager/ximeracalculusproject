\begin{exercise}
    Consider the curve on the graph and the equation of the curve: 
      $$x=y^5-5y^3+4y$$
    \begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    axis lines=middle,
    xlabel={$x$},
    ylabel={$y$},
    xmin=-6, xmax=6,
    ymin=-3, ymax=3,
    grid=both,
    minor tick num=1,
    enlargelimits=false,
    ticklabel style={font=\small},
    every axis x label/.style={at={(current axis.right of origin)}, anchor=west},
    every axis y label/.style={at={(current axis.above origin)}, anchor=south},
  ]

    % Parametric plot: t plays the role of y
    % (x(t), y(t)) = (t^5 - 5 t^3 + 4 t, t)
    \addplot[
      domain=-2.5:2.5,  % extend if you want to see more of the curve
      samples=500,
      very thick,
      blue
    ] ({x^5 - 5*x^3 + 4*x}, {x});

  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
With your group, explain how you would answer the following questions using both the symbolic equation and the curve graph.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Is it possible to express $y$ as an explicit function of $x$? 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Explain your reasoning using the graph.
            \item Explain your reasoning using the symbolic equation for the curve 
        \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
