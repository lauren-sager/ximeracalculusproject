 \begin{exercise}
   Suppose that you have 400 feet of fencing, and you would like to build a rectangular animal pen against a barn.  Fencing is not required on the side along the barn.  
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Draw a sketch of the situation, and label your sketch. 
        \item Write a function, $A(x)$, that represents the area of the enclosed pen.  Your equation should have only one unknown.
        \item What is the domain of $A(x)$?
    \end{enumerate}
