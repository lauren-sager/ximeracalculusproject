\begin{exercise}

 In this problem, let $x$ denote the length of the base of a rectangle. Suppose the height of the rectangle is always half the length of its base.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Draw a labeled sketch of the rectangle.
        \begin{image}
         \includegraphics{funcreview1A.png}
        \end{image}
        \item Let $A(x)$ be a function that gives the area of the rectangle whose base has length $x$. Find a formula for $A(x)$ as a function of $x$.\\
        \textcolor{blue}{$A(x)=(\frac{1}{2}x)x=\frac12 x^2$}
        \item What is the domain of the function $A(x)$? Explain your answer.\\
        \textcolor{blue}{Only positive values of $x$ make sense, as $x$ is representing a length. Domain: all real positive numbers, or $(0,\infty)$.}
        \item Let $P(x)$ be a function that gives the perimeter of the rectangle whose base has length $x$. Find a formula for $P(x)$ as a function of $x$.\\
        \textcolor{blue}{$P(x)=2x+2(\frac12x)=2x+x=3x$}
       % Using the work you did on your homework, 
       \item Write the area of the rectangle, $A(x)$, in terms of the perimeter $P(x)$.\\
       \textcolor{blue}{We can solve $P(x)=3x$ for $x$: $x=\frac{P(x)}{3}$\\
       Sub this value into $A(x)=A(\frac{P(x)}{3})=\frac12(\frac{P(x)}{3})^2=\frac{(P(x))^2}{18}} 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
   Determine the domain of the function $g(x)=\frac{\sqrt{x-1}}{x^2-9}$.\\
   \textcolor{blue}{The domain of a rational function is all numbers where the denominator is not 0, so we set the denominator to 0 and exclude these values.\\
   $x^2-9=0$\\
   $(x-3)(x+3)=0$\\
   $x=3,-3$\\
   We also have to take into account that we can not put a negative value into the square root.\\
   $x-1\geq 0$\\
   $x\geq 1$\\
   Taking these together we get all real numbers greater than 1, except $x=3$, or $[1,3)\cup(3,\infty)$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
     Suppose \[ f(x)=\begin{cases} 
     3x-2 & x< 0 \\
      x^2+1 & 0< x\leq 4 \\
      0 &  4< x 
   \end{cases}
\]
   \begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate $f(-2)$, $f(0)$, $f(3)$ and $f(5)$.\\
    \textcolor{blue}{\[f(-2)=3(-2)-2=-6-2=-8\]
    \[f(3)=3^2+1=10\]
    \[f(5)=0\]
    $f(0)$ does not exist, as the function is not defined at $x=0$.}
    \item Sketch a graph of the function. 
    \begin{image}

  }

    plot ({\x},{3*\x - 2});

    plot ({\x},{\x*\x + 1});
  \draw[blue, line width=0.8pt] (0,1) circle (\opensz);   % open at (0,1)
  \fill[blue] (4,17) circle (\closesz);                   % closed at (4,17)
